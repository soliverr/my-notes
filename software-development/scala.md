### Mill

[Mill](https://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/) - Mill is your shiny new Java/Scala build tool! Scared of SBT? Melancholy over Maven? Grumbling about Gradle? Baffled by Bazel? Give Mill a try!

Mill aims for simplicity by re-using concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas from modern tools like Bazel, to let you build your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill has built in support for the Scala programming language, and can serve as a replacement for SBT, but can also be extended to support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java or Scala) or through external subprocesses.
