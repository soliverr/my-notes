> Yes, Sergei, there are plugins and methods to integrate email with Obsidian, allowing you to add email content to your vault.
> 
> One approach is to use a plugin that focuses on reading or previewing &#x60;.eml&#x60; files directly within Obsidian. The **Email Reader** plugin, for example, allows you to preview the content of &#x60;.eml&#x60; email files in Obsidian&#x27;s Preview mode, similar to how images are embedded. This can be useful for keeping email content visible and organized within your notes without altering the raw email content. It can also import an &#x60;.eml&#x60; file and transform it into markdown based on a customizable template, making the email content searchable within Obsidian.
> 
> Another category of solutions involves forwarding emails to a service or setting up automation to get emails into your vault. Some users have explored using read-it-later apps like Omnivore, which can provide an email address for collecting emails and then syncing with Obsidian., Other more technical approaches involve setting up workflows with tools like Integromat (now Make) and Obsidian Webhooks to receive email data and convert it to markdown before saving it to your vault., There are also discussions and guides on setting up email forwarding to Obsidian using services like IFTTT in conjunction with cloud storage for your vault.
> 
> For specifically fetching emails from Gmail and saving them as markdown notes, the **Obsidian Google Mail** plugin is mentioned. This plugin allows you to automatically save subscribed newsletters or emails you send to yourself into your vault. You can use Gmail labels to filter which emails are fetched.
> 
> Finally, there are plugins like **Email Block** that focus on drafting and planning emails within Obsidian notes using structured code blocks. While this doesn&#x27;t add existing emails to your vault, it demonstrates another way email functionality is being integrated into Obsidian workflows.
> 
> Based on the available information, it seems you have several options for incorporating email into your Obsidian workflow, ranging from simply previewing &#x60;.eml&#x60; files to setting up automated forwarding and fetching systems.
