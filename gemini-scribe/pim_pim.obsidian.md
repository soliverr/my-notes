> Yes, Sergei, there are plugins and methods to integrate email with Obsidian, allowing you to add email content to your vault.
> 
> One approach is to use a plugin that focuses on reading or previewing &#x60;.eml&#x60; files directly within Obsidian. The **Email Reader** plugin, for example, allows you to preview the content of &#x60;.eml&#x60; email files in Obsidian&#x27;s Preview mode, similar to how images are embedded. This can be useful for keeping email content visible and organized within your notes without altering the raw email content. It can also import an &#x60;.eml&#x60; file and transform it into markdown based on a customizable template, making the email content searchable within Obsidian.
> 
> Another category of solutions involves forwarding emails to a service or setting up automation to get emails into your vault. Some users have explored using read-it-later apps like Omnivore, which can provide an email address for collecting emails and then syncing with Obsidian., Other more technical approaches involve setting up workflows with tools like Integromat (now Make) and Obsidian Webhooks to receive email data and convert it to markdown before saving it to your vault., There are also discussions and guides on setting up email forwarding to Obsidian using services like IFTTT in conjunction with cloud storage for your vault.
> 
> For specifically fetching emails from Gmail and saving them as markdown notes, the **Obsidian Google Mail** plugin is mentioned. This plugin allows you to automatically save subscribed newsletters or emails you send to yourself into your vault. You can use Gmail labels to filter which emails are fetched.
> 
> Finally, there are plugins like **Email Block** that focus on drafting and planning emails within Obsidian notes using structured code blocks. While this doesn&#x27;t add existing emails to your vault, it demonstrates another way email functionality is being integrated into Obsidian workflows.
> 
> Based on the available information, it seems you have several options for incorporating email into your Obsidian workflow, ranging from simply previewing &#x60;.eml&#x60; files to setting up automated forwarding and fetching systems.

> You&#x27;re looking for public domain ontologies related to Artificial Intelligence. Ontologies in AI are structured frameworks that represent knowledge, defining concepts, their properties, and the relationships between them. They are crucial for helping AI systems understand, manage, and connect complex information. They are used in areas like natural language processing, the semantic web, and healthcare.
> 
> Here are some resources and examples of public domain or open-source ontologies and knowledge graphs relevant to AI:
> 
> *   **Artificial Intelligence Ontology (AIO):** This is an open-source ontology that systematizes AI concepts, methodologies, and their interrelations. It covers both technical and ethical aspects of AI. It&#x27;s available on GitHub and BioPortal.
> *   **AI Risk Ontology (AIRO):** This is an open-source formal ontology focused on modelling AI use cases and their associated risks, developed based on requirements like the EU AI Act and international standards.
> *   **KNOW (Knowledge Navigator Ontology for the World):** This ontology is designed to capture everyday knowledge to augment large language models (LLMs) in real-world generative AI use cases. It is explicitly placed in the public domain.
> *   **DBpedia:** This knowledge graph leverages structured data from Wikipedia and includes an ontology covering entities like people, organizations, and places.
> *   **Wikidata:** Similar to DBpedia, Wikidata is another large, openly available knowledge graph.
> 
> These ontologies are often represented using languages like Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is a W3C standard for the semantic web. There are also ontology editors like Protégé that are free and open-source, used for building intelligent systems and supporting OWL.
> 
> It&#x27;s worth noting that while many ontologies are publicly available, they can vary in completeness, quality, and specificity to particular applications. However, they serve as valuable resources for standardizing terminology and concepts within the AI domain and promoting data interoperability.

> Okay, Sergei, working with OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies involves several activities, from viewing and editing to querying and using them in applications. OWL is a standard language for representing complex knowledge about things, their properties, and their interrelationships, often used in Artificial Intelligence and the Semantic Web.
> 
> Here&#x27;s a breakdown of common ways to work with OWL ontologies:
> 
> 1.  **Viewing and Browsing:**
>     *   **Ontology Editors:** Tools like Protégé (see below) allow you to open and navigate the structure of an OWL ontology, view classes, properties, individuals, and their definitions.
>     *   **Online Repositories:** Platforms like BioPortal or AberOWL allow you to browse ontologies online via a web interface.
>     *   **Text Editors:** Since OWL files are typically XML-based (RDF/XML) or use other syntaxes like Turtle or Manchester Syntax, you can open them in a plain text editor, though this is difficult for understanding larger ontologies.
> 
> 2.  **Creating and Editing:**
>     *   **Ontology Editors (GUI-based):** This is the most common method.
>         *   **Protégé:** A free, open-source ontology editor developed at Stanford University. It&#x27;s widely used and supports creating, editing, and managing OWL and RDF ontologies. It has a user-friendly interface for defining classes, properties (object, data, annotation), axioms, and individuals.
>         *   Other commercial or less common open-source editors exist (e.g., TopBraid Composer, NeOn Toolkit).
>     *   **Direct Text Editing:** You can write or edit OWL files directly in a text editor using syntaxes like Turtle (.ttl) or OWL Functional Syntax, but this requires a deep understanding of the syntax and is prone to errors for complex ontologies.
> 
> 3.  **Reasoning:**
>     *   **OWL Reasoners:** These are software engines that can infer new knowledge from the explicit information and axioms defined in an ontology. They can check for consistency (identify contradictions), classify classes (determine subsumption hierarchies), and realize individuals (determine the class membership of individuals based on their properties).
>     *   Reasoners like HermiT, FaCT++, Pellet, and ELK are often integrated into ontology editors like Protégé or used programmatically.
> 
> 4.  **Querying:**
>     *   **SPARQL:** The standard query language for RDF data. Since OWL is built upon RDF, you can query OWL ontologies using SPARQL.
>     *   **Tools and Endpoints:** You can use SPARQL query editors (some are built into ontology editors or triple stores) or public SPARQL endpoints provided by data sources (like DBpedia or Wikidata) to retrieve information based on the ontological structure.
>     *   **Programming Libraries:** Libraries (see below) often provide APIs for executing SPARQL queries against an ontology loaded in memory or connected to a triple store.
> 
> 5.  **Using Programmatically:**
>     *   **Libraries/APIs:** Software libraries allow developers to work with OWL ontologies within their applications.
>         *   **OWL API (Java):** A widely used Java API for creating, manipulating, and parsing OWL ontologies. Many reasoners integrate with the OWL API.
>         *   **Apache Jena (Java, Scala, etc.):** A comprehensive framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. It includes APIs for working with RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL.
>         *   **RDFLib (Python):** A Python library for working with RDF, including support for parsing OWL.
>         *   **owlready2 (Python):** Another Python library for ontology-oriented programming with OWL.
>     *   These libraries allow applications to load ontologies, query them, interact with reasoners, and extract information.
> 
> 6.  **Storing Ontologies and Data:**
>     *   **Files:** Ontologies are typically stored as files (e.g., .owl, .rdf, .ttl).
>     *   **Triple Stores (RDF Databases):** For managing large ontologies and the data (individuals) they describe, triple stores or knowledge graph databases (like Virtuoso, GraphDB, AllegroGraph) are used. These databases are optimized for storing and querying RDF data and often include built-in reasoning capabilities or interfaces to external reasoners.
> 
> In summary, working with OWL ontologies usually starts with an ontology editor like Protégé for creation and modification. For querying, SPARQL is the standard. Reasoners help infer new knowledge and check consistency. For integrating ontologies into software, programming libraries are essential, and triple stores are used for managing large-scale knowledge bases.
